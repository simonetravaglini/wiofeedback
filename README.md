Biofeedback sketch for WIO terminal

The purpose of this project is to create a low cost device to track biofeedback signals.
In this moment device is working with GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), in the future we can add HR (hear rate) and EMG.

The project is based on open hardware and open source software.
