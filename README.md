Biofeedback sketch for WIO terminal

The purpose of this project is to create a low cost device to track biofeedback signals.
In this moment device is working with GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), in the future we can add HR (hear rate) and EMG.

The project is based on open hardware and open source software.

With current code you can:
- 1 - track GSR signal, one every second (it's mean of 250 signals)
- 2 - look at graph on terminal
- 3 - send data with serial connection
- 4 - save data on csv on SD card

NOTE: It's not a medical device
